      h3 ROSEdu Challenge Cookbook
      p
        | To get started you should join the ROSEdu Challenge, go to the
        a(href='/')=  " Home "
        | page and click "Start". Also take some time to have a look at our
        a(href='/guidelines')= " Guidelines"
        |
      p
        | As you can see you have a lot of projects from which you can choose. You don't have
        | to pick just one, you can add contributions to all of them. We encourage you to
        | discover all of them. You can't find a project you like? Ping us.
      p
        | We created issues for each repository, you can start by reviewing them.
        | Most of the issues require you to write code, but if you are a design or content
        | enthusiast, don't hold back. Each project could benefit from your expertise.
      p
        | Each project has a mentor who can help you get started with the project, and
        | review your code during the competition. You can mention a mentor in an issue comment,
        | if you have any questions beforehand.

      h3 Why ROSEdu Challenge?
      p
        | We love Open Source and we have a lot of projects which need a community's attention.
        | Events like Upstream Challenge, ROSEDu Summer of Code inspired us in this quest.
      p Learn by contributing! :)

      h3 How to contribute to Open Source?
      p
        | Github has a
        a(href='https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/')= " tutorial "
        | which we recommend you read.
      p
        | You will quickly discover that each project is unique (of course). Most of the
        | projects have a Development/Hack section in the repository README.md, search
        | for that when you browse a new project.

      h3 How to get started with Git and GitHub?
      p
        | We recommend you start with
        a(href='https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1')= " Learn Git "
        | and nothing is better than
        a(href='http://git-scm.com/docs')= " official docs."
      p
        | GitHub is very easy to use, their
        a(href='https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html')= " flow introduction "
        | will help you get started.

      h3 Whom I can ask for help?
      p
        | You can drop us an email from the
        a(href='/contact')= " Contact "
        | section, or
        a(href='https://github.com/blog/821-mention-somebody-they-re-notified')= " mention "
        | one of the mentors in an issue or pull request.
